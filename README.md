derpibooru-url-normalize
========================

This is a very simple user script that automatically redirects you to `derpibooru.org` when you visit a `derpiboo.ru` or `trixiebooru.org` link.

I wrote this because people tend to link to both of the "main" domains, whereas I prefer and am generally only logged in on `derpibooru.org`. Most of the images I am linked to are filtered by default, so it is a pain to change the URL by hand (or log in) every single time in order to do things like clicking on one of the tag links on the image and seeing other default-filtered images with the same tag.
